### Take aways

@ul

- disscuss importance of oGWs (hotspots) in the stratopshere and lower mesosphere
  - particularly focused on the lower stratosphere  
  - using compensation theory by Cohen et al. (2014)
- Himalayas hotspot links to SSW and its dynamical mechanism
- does (meridional) position of GW forcing matter? verification by MUAM?

### Methodology: peak detection

* 20 and 30-day separation => negligible differences
* composite averages based on 45 events for [Himalayas](http://meop40.troja.mff.cuni.cz:11180/ales/accelogw_himalayas_hotspot@70hPa.html), 74 events for [East Asia](http://meop40.troja.mff.cuni.cz:11180/ales/accelogw_eastasia_hotspot@70hPa.html) and 36 events for [West America](http://meop40.troja.mff.cuni.cz:11180/ales/accelogw_westamer_hotspot@70hPa.html)
* lagged analysis of composites up to 10 days (for preceding and following) 
* discussion of dynamical effects in 3D, i.e. not only using zonal mean

### Hypothesis: links to SSW


* position of imposed drag by oGWs may be critical for nonlocal interaction with PWs
  * ~compensation mechanism suggested by Cohen et al. (2014)
  * relative to the surf zone 
* Himalayas composite reveal these features => possible link of lower-stratospheric oGW forcing to SSWs

---

### Hypothesis verification by MUAM?

[effect of equatorward shift of box forcing](http://meop40.troja.mff.cuni.cz:11180/matelo/nadja.new.runs/Diff_Surf-Ref.html)

* warmer stratosphere and colder mesosphere
* weaker PNJ => enhanced amplitude of SPW3 (30-60N)
* in summary: common features detected in CMAM

---

### Conclusions

* common features between Himalayas composite with SSW found
    * warming and ozone enrichment in polar (lower) stratosphere)
    * weaker PV => enhanced upward propagation of PW 
    * stronger wave-drive residual circulation
    * Siberian-high strengthening (Cohen and Jones, 2011) associated with upward PW propagation
* common features indicated in MUAM as well

### To-Do list

- [ ] event seasonality + QBO dependency (PS)
- [ ] introduce critical levels and wave breaking topics (PP)
- [ ] proofreading
- [ ] finalization of figures
- [ ] introduce SSW composite in the study?
