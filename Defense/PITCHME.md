#### Thesis highlights
@ul
- attribution of top-down and bottom-up coupling processes of various timescales in the middle atmosphere
- timescales tackled: decadal: 11-yr solar cycle (SC),  and intraseasonal: orographic gravity waves (oGWs)
- adoption of open-science

#### Thesis targets:
@ul
- (non)linear assessment of 11-yr SC in the middle atmosphere
- aliasing of 11-yr SC in the tropical lower stratosphere (TLS)
- role of parametrized oGWs
